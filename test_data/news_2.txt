Presidential candidate Barack Obama urged the Federal Reserve and the Treasury on Thursday to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the troubled housing market, saying it would help stem the crisis sweeping financial markets.

"The events of the past few days have made clear that we need to do more right now," the Democratic senator from Illinois told a campaign rally in New Mexico.

"That is why I am calling on the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to use their emergency authorities to maintain the flow of credit, to support the availability of mortgages, and to ensure that our financial system is well-capitalized."

In an effort to free up bank-to-bank lending frozen by the Wall Street upheaval, the Fed made an extra $180 billion available to major central banks to lend to their local commercial banks to get U.S. dollars circulating in overnight and short-term money markets.

The latest move brought to $247 billion the total amount of dollars the Fed was providing to other central banks.

As Wall Street grapples with the worst crisis since the Great Depression, the financial turmoil has become the top theme on the campaign trail where Obama is locked in a tight race with his Republican rival John McCain.

The woes at a series of financial firms such as Lehman Brothers Holdings and American International Group are adding to economic anxiety among Americans already struggling with job losses and declining home values.

In addition to calling for a short-term boost to the mortgage market by the Fed and Treasury, Obama also called for legislation that he said would provide a longer-term remedy to the Wall Street turbulence by giving policy makers better tools for managing problems.
