 The plan to move toxic mortgage-related debt off the balance sheets of U.S. banks and
 other institutions, and into a massive government portfolio, represents an all-out
 attack on the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Under authority sought by the U.S. Treasury Department, the government could
purchase as much as $700 billion in mortgage-related assets from U.S.-headquartered
institutions.

Decisions by the treasury secretary related to the buyback program could not be
reviewed by any court, according to a copy of the department's draft legislation.

But the financial "house of cards was much bigger, and it started to stretch
beyond just Wall Street.
