The legislation Congress passed this summer that gave the authority to rescue
Fannie and Freddie boosted the limit on the national debt by $800 billion
to $10.6 trillion.

The legislation the administration is now seeking to authorize the financial
system bailout, according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press, would
boost that debt limit to $11.3 trillion, up another $1.3 trillion.

It is the rapidly rising debt that is cause for concern. The government is
already spending more than $400 billion a year just to pay interest on
the national debt. The higher that debt goes, the higher the government's
borrowing costs and the less it has to spend on other programs.
